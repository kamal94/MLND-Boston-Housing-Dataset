# Predicting Boston Housing Prices
### Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

This project evaluated the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

In this project, a _decision tree regressor_ is fit with the Boston Housing Dataset, and a regression coefficient is used to score the maximum depth to be best used when building the regression tree.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Code is provided in the `boston_housing.ipynb` notebook file. Some support files `visuals.py` are also included.


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `boston_housing/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb```  
```jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is included with the scikit-learn library ([`sklearn.datasets.load_boston`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston)). You do not have to download it separately. You can find more information on this dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) page.
